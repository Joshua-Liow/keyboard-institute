Progress on Prototype halted due to node.js' incompatilibility with Audio functions. Will rewrite the entire prototype with html format. Work over the pass few days was slow due to installation issues of packages, etc.

Date 22/3/18
Progress on the newprototype made. Ran into an issue with mp3 testfile not working in the live server extension in visual studio

Date 23/3/18
Research done on mp3 file. Discovered my linux machine cannot decode mp3 files.
Site used to test which audio file my VM will read: https://hpr.dogphilosophy.net/test/

Date 24/3/18
Further research on html5 limiting issues. Switching over to web audio api, as the audio function provided by html is muddled with mutliple issues and I do not completely understand the issues.

Date 27/3/18
Tested a little on youtube links in using the html functions. Works smoothly, possibly the best solution to playing the recorded video and audio.

Date 30/3/18
Researched into how use youtube into project.

Date 9/4/18
Attended the Monday recording session studio. Spent most of the day recording minutes. Felt like I didn't really do much

Date 10/4/18
When back to looking at hosting on an online cloud database or embedding it into a website.

Date 18/4/18
Provided the researched data on audio implementation into html to the team.

Date 25/4/18
Got access to the audio and hosted it on SoundCloud. KII 330 tracks were copyright claimed by the autobot soundcloud copyright striker. These claims were fought and alternative cloud storage sites were searched. However, most did not support wav format so eventually decided to wait to see how the claims would resolve before attempting to host elsewhere.

Date 27/4/18
Got a message free the tracks from copyright claim. Was creating functions to embed soundcloud tracks into html.

Date 8/5/18
Created a tracklist of each piano's audio on request of Lauchlan which was to be used in the mock-up website(it wasn't). 

Date 10/5/18
Sent a long overdue email to the client Mike regarding his ownership of the recorded audio hosted on soundcloud.

Date 14/5/18
Have been attempting wrapping the embedded links in a javasccript player and using that so the the audio controls layout is not as intrusive. Was not successful even after attempting a few players like jPlayer and the standard html5 audio wrappers so I discontinued the idea.

Date 16-18/5/18
Was working on a video loop function for Seng which he wanted to implement into the virtual tour. Two version were planned to be made,  one using youtube and another using html's video function. After showing the latter to Seng, he was satified enough with the implementation that we decided to not continue the former.

Date 21/5/18
Had to step in a coordinate the group to have a meeting due to plans falling through on the weekend

Date 22/5/18
The group decided to halt all progress and start documenting all research and prototypes.
