Research done on mp3 file. Discovered my linux machine cannot decode mp3 files.
Site used to test which audio file my VM will read: https://hpr.dogphilosophy.net/test/

Further research on html5 limiting issues. Switching over to web audio api, as the audio function provided by html is muddled with mutliple issues and I do not completely understand the issues.
